## Target Scan Application

This Android application is my honors project for the undergraduate study at University of Edinburgh. My supervisor is Julian Bradfield. 

This application is capable to scan target paper used for .22 small-bore rifle shooting at 25 yards distance, and store them locally. The detail information about this project is explained in the dissertation, which is located in the report subfolder. It also includes two python Jupyter notebooks that can be used to try out the image processing algorithm used in the application.
